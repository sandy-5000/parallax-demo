                    The year is 1989.<br /><br />
                    You are a man named Henry who has retreated from your messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched atop a mountain, it&rsquo;s your job to find smoke and keep the wilderness safe.<br /><br />
                    An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor, a woman named Delilah, is available to youat all times over a small, handheld radioâ€”and is your only contact with the world you&rsquo;ve left behind.<br /><br />
                    But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the world below, you&rsquo;ll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and making interpersonal choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful relationship you have.
